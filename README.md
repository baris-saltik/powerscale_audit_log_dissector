Dissects PowerScale Audit Log Entries

Create a file under_log_examples folder, and insert example log entries from PowerScale isi_audit_view command output into the file by entering each entry on a single line. You can add comments into the file by prepending your comments with "#" character, so that the output can have your comments too.
